2. STOP/DISABLE LOG SHIPPING BACKUP JOBS

3. RUN (LOG SHIPPING) TRAN LOG COPY AND RESTORE JOBS ON Secondary until the last log is applied then DISABLE all copy & restore jobs.

4. REMOVE THE LOG-SHIPPING FROM PRIMARY SERVER’S MAINTENANCE PLANS for the required Db's

ii. delete destination server information from inside the maintenance job for each DB.

iii. remove logshipping & delete maintenance job

5. Kill all users IN Required database on primary server

6. BACKUP LAST TRAN LOG On Primary Server and place them is easy accessible folder Eg.(\\Primary Server Name\C$\MSSQL\Backup\FTRN)

eg. BACKUP LOG Check21DB TO DISK = 'C:\MSSQL\BACKUP\FTRN\' WITH norecovery

7. COPY LAST LOGS TO Secondary Server to say ‘FTRN’ folder (\\Secondary Server \C$\MSSQL\Backup\FTRN)

E.g
