Policy Management:
==================

Initial Setup
-------------

o - Select a server to act as the central management server - CMS
o - Import best practice policies (only available with EE) - .../policies/... (disable)
o - When importing to target servers would choose preserve state on import
o - Enable any required policies (cannot enable on demand, have to schedule...)
o - Right click, evaluate to check a policy on local server
o - For on demand evaluation against target servers, setup a management (configuration) server
    then evaluate against target servers from CMS using right/click, evaluate.  For automated checks
    e.g. on demand, you need to export the policy to disk, then run import policies from CMS which will
    push the policy down to all target servers, at this point it can be scheduled or checked on demand
o - Right clicking server node marked with icon and selecting view will show any failed policy checks for target
o - Custom policies can be created by creating new conditions for existing facet components, this release
    does not allow end user facet creation
o - Enforcement modes are on demand, on schedule, on changes - log only and on changes prevent, not all modes
    are available for all conditions

o - You can create and run dynamic code as a condition e.g. check vlf count
o - You can create alerts based on policy failure error codes - onchange prevent(auto) - 34050, onchange prevent
    (on demand) 34051, On Schedule 34052, On Change 34053
o - On change log goes to application event log
o - Creating new conditions - can use LIKE with wildcards e.g. 'tbl_%' and also CODE with ExecuteSql!
