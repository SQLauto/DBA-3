Peer to Peer Replication Sequence:
==================================

Initial Setup
-------------

o - Ensure SQL Agent started and set to automatically startup

o - Manage identity columns at source and target either by ranges or composite keys
    Identity columns will require reseeding e.g. :
    DBCC CHECKIDENT ("[XYZMain].[dbo].[Customers]", noreseed);
    DBCC CHECKIDENT ("[XYZMain].[dbo].[Customers]", RESEED, 200000);
    Composites primary including local state guarantees uniqueness across servers
    NOT FOR Replication - means that the constraint will NOT be applied by repl agents

o - Setup the distributor at all nodes - still require a replication snapshot share as P2P is transactional
    A publisher can only publish to one distributor, however a distributor may have many publishers

o - Create transactional publication, no filtering, no initial snapshot(?), set security

o - Convert the transactional replication created above to a peer to peer type (careful with nodeid)

o - If peer is already initialised with data, access properties of publication and add the node by
    selecting 'configure peer to peer topology'. Select the option detailing how the peer was initialised


Adding a New Peer Node
----------------------
 
o - setup distributor on new node

o - snapshots are not used to initialise peers, best practice is a backup from an existing node with P2P set

o - Take a full database backup from one of the peer nodes (ensure P2P article is configured before backup)

o - Restore to new target node WITH RECOVERY

o - Change primary key default if managed with composite key OR reseed Identity columns as appropriate

o - Add new node to topology from an existing node using 'configure peer to peer topology'
